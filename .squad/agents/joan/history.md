# Joan — History

## Project Seed

- **Project:** codetopo — MCP server in C++ for indexing symbols/relations across large codebases
- **Stack:** C++20, CMake, vcpkg, SQLite, tree-sitter, Catch2
- **User:** Cristiano
- **Key challenge:** Unit tests pass (173 cases, 914 assertions) but real-world indexing of 162k-file codebase crashes repeatedly with 0xC0000409. Tests don't cover the actual production failure path.
